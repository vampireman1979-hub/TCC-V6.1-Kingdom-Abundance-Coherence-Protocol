# TCC-V6.1-Kingdom-Abundance-Coherence-Protocol
TCC‑V6.1 is a deterministic, idempotent state‑transformation pipeline that encodes symbolic principles of “integrity,” “abundance,” and “coherence” into a reproducible computational process.   It operates on a shared state object and applies monotonic, non‑coercive updates that stabilize the system into a coherent, conflict‑free configuration.
