# TCC-V6.1-Kingdom-Abundance-Coherence-Protocol
TCC‑V6.1 is a deterministic, idempotent state‑transformation pipeline that encodes symbolic principles of “integrity,” “abundance,” and “coherence” into a reproducible computational process.   It operates on a shared state object and applies monotonic, non‑coercive updates that stabilize the system into a coherent, conflict‑free configuration.

TCC‑V6.1: Kingdom Abundance & Coherence Protocol

A Symbolic‑Scientific State Transformation Pipeline

---

Overview

TCC‑V6.1 is a deterministic pipeline that transforms a shared state object through a sequence of monotonic, idempotent stages.  
It preserves symbolic terminology from the TCC lineage while grounding each concept in a clear computational and scientific interpretation.

The protocol ensures:

- Integrity never decreases  
- Abundance never decreases  
- Coherence remains maximized  
- Conflict remains minimized  
- Tags are aligned deterministically  

This produces a stable, reproducible final state suitable for diagnostics, tooling, and integration into larger systems.

State Model

The shared state (TCCState) contains:

| Field       | Symbolic Meaning | Scientific Interpretation |
|-------------|------------------|---------------------------|
| status    | Node activation  | Finite‑state machine flag |
| integrity | Law 60106        | Baseline scalar threshold |
| abundance | Kingdom metric   | Monotonic resource value  |
| coherence | Alignment        | Normalized stability (0–1)|
| conflict  | Disharmony       | Non‑negative error metric |
| tags      | Alignment marks  | Deterministic diagnostics |

Pipeline Stages

1. Activation
Symbolic: Open the node  
Scientific: Set status = ACTIVE (idempotent)

2. Integrity Lock
Symbolic: Law 60106  
Scientific: Enforce minimum integrity and coherence; clamp conflict to 0

3. Abundance Expansion
Symbolic: Kingdom abundance  
Scientific: Enforce minimum abundance baseline

4. Tag Alignment
Symbolic: Alignment marks  
Scientific: Deterministic metadata for tooling and inspection

---

Execution

`python
from tccv61 import runtcc_v61

finalstate = runtcc_v61()
print(final_state.snapshot())
`

Output is a JSON‑serializable snapshot of the final aligned state.

Scientific Interpretation of Symbolism

The symbolic language of TCC‑V6.1 maps cleanly to computational primitives:

- “Kingdom” → system domain  
- “Abundance” → monotonic resource metric  
- “Integrity” → invariant baseline  
- “Coherence” → normalized stability  
- “Conflict” → error or divergence  
- “Alignment” → deterministic tagging  

This allows the protocol to maintain its symbolic lineage while remaining fully compatible with scientific reasoning, reproducible computation, and integration into quantum or classical pipelines.
